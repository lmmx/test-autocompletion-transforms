# test-autocompletion-transforms

- Test out argcomplete to autocomplete custom representations of filenames under a given directory
- These custom representations would be 'transformations' from e.g.:
  - stripping off the file extension,
  - removing alphabetic characters from alphanumeric directory names,
  - (generally anything done to filenames that shorten or summarise for ease of CLI entry)
